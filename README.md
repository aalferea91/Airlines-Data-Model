# Airlines-Data-Model
In this project I will design a datawarehouse model and itÂ´s different ETLS according to specific requirements.

1. Create a data model that will allow to analyze the different routes for airlines based in different dimensions: airport, airline, country or equipment.

Examples of analysis:
-Number of routes by airport, airline, and country. With the possibility to filter the information by type of route (domestic or international).
-Rankings:
        1. Airports with highest number of routes.
        2. Airlines with the highest number of routes.
        3. Countries with the highest number of routes.
        4. Countries with the highest number of airlines.
        5. Equipments that are most used.
The objective of this question is only to design the model with the different entities, their relations, primary and foreign keys and main attributes of each entity.
